            <h2>Submit Your Proposal</h2>
            <div>
            <p>Annex Theatre is a democratic collective of theatre artists dedicated to creating bold new work in an environment of improbability, resourcefulness, and risk. Read our full bio on our <a href="http://www.annextheatre.org" target="_blank">website</a>.
                <br /><br />
            For 31 years, we've produced brand-new plays, ensemble-generated non-linear spectacles, radical interpretations of classic texts, and dynamic solo shows. If any of these productions sound like something you want to see on the Annex stage, then you should propose!
                <br /><br />
            If you've landed here, you are looking for an opportunity to submit a proposal for production at Annex Theatre. We will be opening our RFP for 2019 (our 32nd season) on May 1, 2018. Every spring, Annex Theatre chooses its productions for the following year. We will be looking for 8 brand-new world premiere projects for our 2019 season &#40;February-November&#41;. We produce 4 mainstage projects and 4 off-night or late night plays. We distribute our <strong>Request For Proposals &#40;RFP&#41;</strong> far and wide. Proposals can be for a scripted play, work in development, ensemble-generated who-knows-what; or anything else that sounds compelling and you think you can persuade the Annex Company&mdash;the body of artists and technicians who make Annex Theatre function&mdash;to produce. Proposals are accepted on a rolling basis and pitch sessions are scheduled once the entire submission is complete (submission form, artist statement, resume, and script).
                <br /><br />
            Mainstage projects can be a production of an existing script, a rich ensemble-generated work that starts from an idea, or whatever else you can persuade us to accept. Mainstage shows run Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays at 7:30 pm. Each mainstage production will have a mid-run Monday Industry Night performance included.
                <br /><br />
            Off-night or late night projects open the second week &#40;or weekend&#41; of the mainstage production's run and close during the week &#40;or night&#41; before the mainstage closes. Off-night or late night projects must be simple to produce because they are afforded less resources than the mainstage. They receive approximately one-quarter of the mainstage budget, one-quarter of the tech time, and little onstage rehearsal time. They must be able to take place on the set and use the lighting design of the mainstage production. Off-night shows run on Tuesdays and Wednesdays at 7:30 pm. Late night shows run Fridays and Saturdays at 11 pm, with one 7:30 pm Industry Night show on a Monday, mid-run. 
                <br /><br />
            As producers and artists, we intentionally uphold very specific values and insist that the work we produces upholds these values as well.</p>
            <h4>Annex's Values:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>World-premiere &#40;We like PNW premieres too&#41;</li>
                    <li>Big, cheap theatre using spectacle!</li>
                    <li>Diversity, equity and inclusion</li>
                    <li>Opportunities for Annex company members</li>
                </ul>
            <p>We primarily produce local &#40;to Seattle&#41; work but are willing to work with non-local playwrights and directors. We are an all-volunteer fringe theatre company, so we cannot offer any compensation other than the volunteer stipend at the close of the production. Producing with Annex Theatre is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for developing and emerging artists to work in a consensus-driven collective environment.
                <br /><br />
                Here are the following types of people who typically submit to Annex Theatre:</p>

                    <li>Playwright</li>
