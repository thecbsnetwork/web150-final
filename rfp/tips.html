                <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
                <p>Ideally no longer than one page in length, an artist statement is an opportunity for you to showcase your personality and style to us at Annex. They are typically written in first person. We ask these of playwrights, directors, and any other proposers in order to learn from you why your are passionate about producing this specific production with Annex.</p>
              </div>
              <div id="tabs-2">
                <h2>Bold New Work</h2>
                <p>Although defined differently by the individual artists and audience members who pass through our doors, bold new work is what Annex produces on its stage. We produce plays never seen before that are forward-thinking. We produce them cheaply with our production incredibly small budgets are &#40;compared to others&#41; yet we are consistently nominated for critical awards. We look for the plays about topics currently at the top of consciousness in society. All of these factors and more contribute to <strong>bold new work</strong></p>
              </div>
              <div id="tabs-3">
                <h2>Co-Production</h2>
                <p>Annex prefers to produce our own plays, having a hand in each and every element of production, but it doesn't mean we don't like to make friends. We would love to talk about a co-production, especially to bring in new audiences. If you want to contribute a significant portion of your artistic and/or financial resources, a co-production may be the way to go. We have produced these as part of our season in the past. Be sure to mention it in your proposal and we'll discuss it in more detail at your pitch session.</p>
              </div>
              <div id="tabs-4">
                <h2>Company</h2>
                <p>Annex is an all-volunteer organization, run by a Company of volunteer artists and producers. These are the people who will choose the plays since they'll be the ones doing the work to produce them! When crafting your proposal, don't worry if you don't know any of us. We're very friendly.</p>
              </div>
              <div id="tabs-5">
                <h2>Elevator Pitch</h2>
                <p>A short description of your play or project that takes 30 seconds or less.</p>
              </div>
              <div id="tabs-6">
                <h2>Late night</h2>
                <p>A 5 or 6 show run that performs at 11 pm on Friday and Saturday nights for 3 weeks. Late night shows cannot perform on opening night of the mainstage nor the night of Spin the Bottle (which runs every first Friday of the month). They have a Monday primetime Industry Night show. Late nights get about 1/4 of the design budget, tech time, and resources of a mainstage show. Burlesque and clown pieces are best suited to this time slot.</p>
              </div>
              <div id="tabs-7">
                <h2>Mainstage</h2>
                <p>A 13 show run that performs at 7:30 pm on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights for 4 weeks. Every Thursday is PWYC, and there is a Monday Industry Night show. Mainstage productions are big and splashy pieces, produced on a tight budget using creativity!</p>
              </div>
              <div id="tabs-8">
                <h2>Off-night</h2>
                <p>A 7 show run that performs at 7:30 pm on Tuesday and Wednesday nights for 3 weeks. They have a Monday Industry Night show. Off-nights get about 1/4 of the design budget, tech time, and resources of a mainstage show. One-person shows and experimental works are best suited to this time slot.</p>
              </div>
              <div id="tabs-9">
                <h2>Pacific Northwest Premiere</h2>
                <p>Your play has been produced somewhere else in the world, but never before in the Puget Sound/Portland/Vancouver region. Although we primarily produce world premieres, if we really like a play we will commit to producing the PNW premiere.</p>
              </div>
              <div id="tabs-10">
                <h2>Pitch Session</h2>
                <p>A chance for you to meet the Annex Company and tell us about your show!<br /><br />
                  <strong>Once scheduled, pitch sessions are 20 minutes long.</strong></p>
                  <p>We schedule several pitch sessions in an evening, with 5 minute breaks in between. Please arrive a few minutes early so that we can get started right away. An awesome pitch session includes:</p>
                  <ul>
                  <li>5 minute introduction</li>
                  <li>5 minute show sample</li>
                      <ul>
                      <li>Scene</li>
                      <li>Songs</li>
                      <li>Photos</li>
                      <li>Handouts</li>
                      <li>Slideshow</li>
                      <li>Presentation</li>
                      <li>Video</li>
                      <li>Showcase yourself and your piece!</li>
                      </ul>
                  <li>10 minutes for questions</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Of course you may adjust this template, but we ask that you leave ample time for questions and conversation with us.</p>
              </div>
              <div id="tabs-11">
                <h2>Rental</h2>
                <p>A production done at Annex that is <em>not</em> one of our 8 shows. Rentals receive a key to the space, storage, ticketing, Front of house volunteers, and a dedicated rental tech who may also run the board for your show. We do not do create marketing assets or do promotion for rentals.</p>
              </div>
              <div id="tabs-12">
                <h2>RFP</h2>
                <p>Request for proposals.</p>
              </div>
              <div id="tabs-13">
                <h2>Season Showdown</h2>
                <p>The Annex selection process. Following the pitch sessions, we gather for two separate days to discuss all of the plays we've read and choose our next season through a process of consensus.</p>
              </div>
              <div id="tabs-14">
                <h2>Stipend</h2>
                <p>A small amount paid to artists who volunteer their time.</p>
              </div>
              <div id="tabs-15">
                <h2>Workshop</h2>
                <p>A workshop is part of the play development process. It can be a private or public reading, staged or done at a table. They're typically followed by a talkback session to help the playwright develop the play further but that's not a required component. Workshops are driven primarily by the artists and are not a guaranteed part of the Annex production process, even though we really like them!</p>
              </div>
              <div id="tabs-16">
                <h2>World premiere</h2>
                <p>A brand new play!</p>
