            <div id="accordion">
              <h3>When can I submit my play?</h3>
              <div>
                <p>
                We will be opening the request for proposals May 1-15, 2018.
                </p>
              </div>
              <h3>When do I get to schedule my pitch session?</h3>
              <div>
                <p>
                Once you fill out the form, we'll review your proposal. If we think your show would be a good fit for our stage, we will schedule your pitch session. We try to meet with everyone, but that is not always possible.<br /><br /><em>Not sure what a pitch session is? Check out our <a href="tips.html">Tips &amp; Tricks</a> page!</em>
                </p>
              </div>
              <h3>Who should be at my pitch session?</h3>
              <div>
                <p>
                Definitely you. Plus your producing partners: director, playwright, composer, dramaturg, and actors (for scene excerpts). Actors are not expected to stay the entire time.
                </p>
              </div>
              <h3>What do I do if my play isn't chosen?</h3>
              <div>
                <p>
                We only have 8 slots for each calendar year and typically receive 70+ proposals. We just can't produce them all! If your play is not chosen for one season, it could be chosen the next. Some proposers for pitch many years running before a project of theirs is chosen!
                </p>
              </div>
              <h3>What if my play would be a better fit as a rental?</h3>
              <div>
                <p>
                Let's talk! We aim to curate our rental season to align with our values as a producing organization, as well as provide much-needed space to self-producing artists. Email <a href="mailto:rentals@annextheatre.org">rentals@annextheatre.org</a>.
                </p>
              </div>
              <h3>Do I have to have seen a show at Annex to pitch?</h3>
              <div>
                <p>
                No, but it's preferred and we strongly encourage you to have seen a production at Annex before you pitch to us. Annex Theatre produces a wild mix of new work, and if you've seen anything we've done, you'll get a better handle on our current aesthetic. We ask that you have seen a show within the last 5  years because Annex has been around for 30 and we have evolved over time. If you've seen a recent production&mdash;or better yet, worked on one recently&mdash;you'll have a good read on what and how we produce.
                </p>
              </div>
              <h3>Does my play have to be new?</h3>
              <div>
                <p>
                Annex trucks in bold, new work. This means we LOVE new plays. We love thinking about them, working on them, breathing on them, and producing them. It's just like, what we do. BUT if you have a super cool idea of how to re-interpret something REALLY old like say, <em>Hamlet</em>, then we might be interested. Go ahead and submit, and let's talk.
                </p>
              </div>
              <h3>My play is unfinished/not written yet/needs a lot of work. Help!</h3>
              <div>
                <p>
                It's okay. Although we rarely choose unfinished plays, it does happen. We also occasionally choose plays that evolve over time. Even if your play isn't complete yet, we still want you to submit!
                </p>
              </div>
              <h3>My playwright is not local. Am I good?</h3>
              <div>
                <p>
                Although we primarily produce new and local work, we have worked with out-of-town playwrights in the past. They must agree to a $250 stipend &#40;we cannot pay anymore in royalties or other fees&#41; and possibly be willing to adapt and edit their work based on feedback from the company. Part of our excitement about producing new plays is that we get to produce.  We get to have a say in how the play is shaped and developed, so that our audiences and company will get as excited as you are. If your playwright isn't local, we hope that you have a really strong connection with them. 
                </p>
              </div>
              <h3>I'm not local. Will you still produce my play?</h3>
              <div>
                <p>
                We have directors and company members who are interested in working with us and do not have a play to pitch. If you are not local, you may still pitch&mdash;we will do a video call for the pitch session&mdash;but someone local, like the director, will need to be in Seattle to do the play!
                </p>
              </div>
              <h3>I don't have a director. Is that ok?</h3>
              <div>
                <p>
                Yes! We get excited about the people AND the work. If you don't have a director, we can assure you that we have plenty of company members who are potentially interested and local connections to help you find the perfect creative team. 
                </p>
              </div>
              <h3>I'm a director but I don't have a play...</h3>
              <div>
                <p>
                No problem! We will be opening up the submission process for director interest on May 1. We would love to meet you!
                </p>
              </div>
              <h3>What is the deal with stipends?</h3>
              <div>
                <p>
                Annex is an all-volunteer theatre company. Our hope is that the stipend we offer to artists covers any potential costs you may incur while creating your art &#40;i.e. a parking ticket&#41;. We know that the stipends we offer are well below what is considered normal and viable in our town, but to stipend every artist what they're worth would... well, let's just put it this way: Annex survives and thrives on volunteer labor. 
                </p>
              </div>
              <h3>Do you accept Equity proposals?</h3>
              <div>
                <p>
                No. We are unable to pay Equity wages nor acquire an equity waiver.
                </p>
              </div>
              <h3>Do I have to be local?</h3>
              <div>
                <p>
                You do not have to be local, but we like for someone accountable to the project to be local for matters related to production. If you pitch this show as a playwright and you're not local, we hope that your director is. The director is ultimately responsible for the success of the project.
                </p>
              </div>
              <h3>When do you decide the plays?</h3>
              <div>
                <p>
                We have two sessions in mid-June affectionally called <strong>Season Showdown</strong> when we will choose our plays through consensus as a Company.
                </p>
              </div>
              <h3>How do you choose the plays?</h3>
              <div>
                <p>
                Company members of Annex attend as many pitch sessions as they can and read all of the plays. Then we gather to talk about every submission and whether or not it will be a good fit for our stage. Then we debate, discuss, and deliberate until a season is chosen by consensus. &#40;Yes, consensus! By the end of the selection process, the Company backs each of the 8 shows in a season together.&#41;
                </p>
              </div>
              <h3>I am a Company member. Can I participate in the season selection process and pitch too?</h3>
              <div>
                <p>
                One of the perks of being an Annex Company member is that you get to participate in the season selection process! We invite Company members who pitch to also read the other plays, attend the other pitch sessions &#40;get some tips!&#41;, and be present at the season selection day. 
                </p>
              </div>
              <h3>Your RFP doesn't fit my aesthetic. Where else can I submit?</h3>
              <div>
